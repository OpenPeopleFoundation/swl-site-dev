## Link Density Analysis

### High-Density Nodes (6+ links)
- Mission (core hub)
- Guest Experience (application hub)
- Intention (core concept)
- Emotion (core concept)
- Craft (core concept)

### Medium-Density Nodes (4-5 links)
- Menu Design
- Service Philosophy
- Training Philosophy
- Newfoundland Context
- Operations Rhythm

### Lower-Density Nodes (2-3 links)
- Specific topics (Ingredient Sourcing, Space Design, etc.)
- Development nodes (Pre-Opening, Post-Opening)

## Reciprocal Links

Some relationships are reciprocal (A links to B, B links to A):

- Mission ↔ Intention, Emotion, Craft
- Intention ↔ Emotion ↔ Craft
- Guest Experience ↔ Service Philosophy
- Training Philosophy ↔ Staff Culture

## One-Way Links

Some relationships are directional (A links to B, but B doesn't link back):

- Origin Story → Mission (Mission doesn't need to link back)
- Pre-Opening → Opening Roadmap (roadmap doesn't need to link back)
- Specific topics → Core concepts (core concepts don't always link to specifics)

## Link Maintenance

### When Adding New Breadcrumbs:
1. Identify which cluster it belongs to
2. Link to 2-3 core concepts
3. Link to 1-2 application nodes
4. Link to 1-2 context nodes
5. Update this map

### When Updating Existing Breadcrumbs:
1. Review link relevance
2. Add links to new related content
3. Remove links that are no longer relevant
4. Update this map

### Validation:
- Check that all links in map exist as files
- Verify link density is appropriate
- Ensure no node is isolated
- Confirm core concepts are well-connected

This link map serves as both documentation and a guide for maintaining the semantic lattice structure.
