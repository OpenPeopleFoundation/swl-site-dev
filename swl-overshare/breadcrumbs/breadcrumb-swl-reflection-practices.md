# Reflection Practices at Snow White Laundry

## Summary
Reflection practices at Snow White Laundry ensure that the restaurant learns from experience and evolves intentionally. After each service, staff debrief, noting what worked, what didn't, and what can be improved. These reflections are documented, creating institutional memory that informs future decisions.

Reflection is not just about identifying problems, but about understanding why things worked or didn't work. It requires honesty, curiosity, and a willingness to change course when necessary. The goal is not to achieve perfection and maintain it, but to practice continuous improvement.

The restaurant reflects on multiple levels: individual performance, team dynamics, guest experience, operational efficiency, and philosophical alignment. Each level informs the others, creating a holistic understanding of how the restaurant functions and how it can improve.

## Core Principles
- Reflection is scheduled, not optional.
- Documentation preserves learning for future use.
- Reflection includes both successes and failures.
- Changes based on reflection are implemented and evaluated.
- Reflection is constructive, not punitive.

## Signals & Behaviours
- Post-service debriefs are standard practice.
