# Dietary Accommodation at Snow White Laundry

## Summary
Dietary accommodation at Snow White Laundry treats dietary needs and restrictions as opportunities to care, not obstacles to overcome. The restaurant recognizes that dietary requirements—whether medical, ethical, or personal—are part of who guests are, and accommodating them is fundamental to hospitality.

Accommodation is handled with intention and care. Staff are trained to understand common dietary restrictions, to communicate clearly about ingredients and preparation, and to work with the kitchen to create alternatives that maintain the integrity of the experience. Accommodation should feel seamless, not like a compromise.

The restaurant is transparent about what it can and cannot accommodate. Some restrictions can be handled easily; others require advance notice or may not be possible. Honesty about limitations is preferable to promising what cannot be delivered.
