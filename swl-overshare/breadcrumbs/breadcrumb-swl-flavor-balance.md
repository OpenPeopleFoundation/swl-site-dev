# Flavor Balance at Snow White Laundry

## Summary
Flavor balance at Snow White Laundry is achieved through careful calibration of taste elements—sweet, salty, sour, bitter, umami—and their interaction with texture, temperature, and timing. The goal is not complexity for its own sake, but clarity and harmony that allows each ingredient to express itself while contributing to a unified whole.

Balance is evaluated not just technically, but emotionally. A dish might be technically balanced but emotionally flat, or technically imperfect but emotionally resonant. The restaurant seeks both technical excellence and emotional impact, recognizing that they are not always the same thing.

Balance also considers the progression of a meal. Early courses might be lighter, brighter, more acidic. Middle courses develop depth and complexity. Later courses provide satisfaction and closure. The balance of individual dishes serves the balance of the overall experience.

## Core Principles
- Balance serves flavor and emotion, not just technique.
- Each ingredient should express itself while contributing to the whole.
