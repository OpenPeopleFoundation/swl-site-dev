# Intention at Snow White Laundry

## Summary
Intention at Snow White Laundry means that nothing is purely decorative or accidental. The layout of the room, the pacing of the menu, and the way a guest is greeted at the door are all treated as intentional acts.

Intention is the filter used to decide what belongs in the restaurant and what does not. If a detail cannot be justified in terms of guest experience, emotional resonance, or operational clarity, it is removed or redesigned.

## Core Principles
- Every recurring decision must have a written reason that can be reflected on later.
- Intention is measured by how well actions align with stated values.
- Silence, space, and restraint are valid intentional choices.

## Signals & Behaviours
- Staff use the language of 'why' more often than 'because that’s how it’s done.'
- New ideas are evaluated against the mission, not just trend or cost.
- Playlists, lighting, and menu changes are documented with a clear rationale.
