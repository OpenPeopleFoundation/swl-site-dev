# Ritual Development at Snow White Laundry

## Summary
Ritual development at Snow White Laundry treats recurring actions as opportunities to create meaning and consistency. Rituals are not arbitrary traditions, but intentional practices that reinforce the restaurant's values and create predictable, comforting patterns for both guests and staff.

Rituals are developed through observation, reflection, and iteration. They are tested for effectiveness and refined based on feedback. They are documented so they can be taught consistently and maintained over time. The goal is not to create rigid procedures, but to develop practices that feel natural while serving clear purposes.

Rituals exist at multiple levels: greeting rituals, service rituals, closing rituals, staff rituals. Each serves a purpose in creating coherence and meaning. They become part of the restaurant's identity, expressions of its philosophy in action.

- Rituals must serve clear purposes, not just tradition.
- Rituals are developed through observation and iteration.
