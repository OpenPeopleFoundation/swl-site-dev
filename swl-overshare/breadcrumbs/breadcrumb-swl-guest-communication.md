# Guest Communication at Snow White Laundry

## Summary
Guest communication at Snow White Laundry is designed to inform without overwhelming, to engage without intruding, to clarify without condescending. The restaurant recognizes that guests arrive with different levels of knowledge and interest, and communication must adapt to meet them where they are.

Communication happens at multiple levels: menu descriptions, verbal explanations, written materials, digital channels. Each channel serves a purpose and is designed with intention. Menu descriptions are clear but not exhaustive. Verbal explanations are offered when helpful, not forced. Written materials provide depth for those who want it.

The tone of communication reflects the restaurant's aesthetic: calm, reflective, respectful. It assumes intelligence without requiring expertise. It provides information without being didactic. It invites curiosity without demanding engagement.
