# Guest Experience at Snow White Laundry

## Summary
Guest experience at Snow White Laundry is designed as a calm, coherent journey rather than a sequence of disconnected service moments. The aim is to reduce friction, avoid performative hospitality, and create a sense of being quietly looked after.

The restaurant assumes that many guests arrive with decision fatigue. Menus, pacing, and interactions are structured to feel supportive, not overwhelming.

## Core Principles
- Guests should never feel rushed or stalled for long periods without communication.
- The room should feel warm and attentive, not theatrical.
- Surprises are welcome, but never at the cost of comfort or consent.

## Signals & Behaviours
- Guests rarely need to flag staff; help tends to arrive just before it is needed.
- Dietary needs and preferences are handled smoothly, without visible stress.
- Feedback loops (post‑service notes, follow‑up messages) are built into the operation.
