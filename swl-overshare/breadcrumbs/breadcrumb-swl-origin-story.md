# Snow White Laundry Origin Story

## Summary
Snow White Laundry takes its name from an earlier life of the space and the city around it. The project emerges from a desire to honour local history while building something unmistakably modern.

The origin story is not nostalgia for its own sake, but an anchor: a reminder that the restaurant is part of a longer narrative of work, service, and care in St. John’s. The name is a promise to treat that history with respect while doing something new.

## Core Principles
- History is referenced with humility, not exploited as a prop.
- The story of the space is shared with staff so they can share it with guests authentically.
- The origin story evolves as the restaurant grows, but its core remains intact.

## Signals & Behaviours
- Staff can explain the name ‘Snow White Laundry’ in a grounded, non‑gimmicky way.
- Design details nod to the building’s past without turning the room into a museum.
- Local guests recognise elements of their own city in the narrative.
