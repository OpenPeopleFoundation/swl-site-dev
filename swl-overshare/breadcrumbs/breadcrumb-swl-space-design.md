# Space Design at Snow White Laundry

## Summary
Space design at Snow White Laundry treats the physical environment as an ingredient in the guest experience. Every element—layout, lighting, acoustics, materials, flow—is considered in terms of how it supports intention, emotion, and craft. Nothing is decorative; everything serves a purpose.

The design process involves multiple iterations, each tested against the core principles. The space must support both the guest experience and the staff's ability to execute at a high level. It must feel calm and reflective, not theatrical or overwhelming. It must age gracefully, becoming more itself over time.

Materials are chosen for durability and beauty, not just appearance. Finishes are selected to support the restaurant's aesthetic while standing up to daily use. Systems are installed with future maintenance in mind. The space is built to last, to support the restaurant's mission over years, not just months.

## Core Principles
- Design serves function, not just aesthetics.
- Every element must justify its place in terms of guest experience or operations.
