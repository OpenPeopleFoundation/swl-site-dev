# Menu Design at Snow White Laundry

## Summary
Menu design at Snow White Laundry focuses on clarity, progression, and operational sanity. The menu is built to be executed consistently on busy nights while still feeling personal and alive.

Both à la carte and tasting formats, if offered, are designed to minimise decision fatigue and avoid unnecessary complexity for guests and staff.

## Core Principles
- Menus should be short enough to remember, but deep enough to explore.
- Each dish must justify its place on the menu in terms of intention, emotion, and craft.
- Pricing must reflect real costs while preserving a sense of fairness.

## Signals & Behaviours
- Prep and service flows remain stable as the menu evolves.
- Guests rarely express confusion about what they are ordering.
- Menu changes are driven by learning, not panic.
