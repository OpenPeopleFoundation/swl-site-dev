# Snow White Laundry Mission

## Summary
Snow White Laundry exists to create a restaurant where intention, emotion, and craft are treated as primary ingredients. The mission is to build a space in St. John’s, Newfoundland, where guests feel seen, cared for, and quietly surprised by the depth of thought behind each decision.

The restaurant is not only a place to eat, but a living system that remembers choices, learns from feedback, and refines its rituals over time. Everything—from the menu to the music level—is part of a deliberate attempt to practice care at scale.

## Core Principles
- Every decision must be traceable back to intention, emotion, or craft.
- Guest dignity is a non‑negotiable constraint.
- Operational polish should never override human warmth.

## Signals & Behaviours
- Staff can explain the 'why' behind menu, service, and design choices.
- Guests consistently describe the experience as thoughtful and emotionally grounded.
- Internal systems favour reflection and iteration over shortcuts.
