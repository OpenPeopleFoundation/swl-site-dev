# Tasting Discipline at Snow White Laundry

## Summary
Tasting discipline at Snow White Laundry is the systematic practice of evaluating dishes at multiple stages of development and service. It requires attention to balance, harmony, and emotional impact. Tasting is not just about identifying flaws, but about understanding how flavors, textures, and temperatures work together to create an experience.

The discipline recognizes that taste is subjective but that certain principles of balance and harmony are universal. Tasting must be done with intention, not habit. Each taste serves a purpose: to evaluate balance, to check seasoning, to assess texture, to understand the emotional impact of a dish.

Tasting discipline extends beyond the kitchen. Service staff taste dishes to understand what they are serving, to communicate effectively with guests, to recognize when something is not right. This shared understanding creates coherence between kitchen and service.

## Core Principles
- Tasting must be intentional, not habitual.
- Dishes are evaluated at multiple stages: raw ingredients, during cooking, final plating, during service.
- Balance is evaluated both technically and emotionally.
- Multiple perspectives are valuable; tasting is collaborative.
- Documentation of tasting notes preserves learning.

## Signals & Behaviours
- Dishes are tasted systematically at each stage of development.
- Tasting notes are documented and reviewed.
- Staff can articulate why a dish works or doesn't work.
- Adjustments are made based on tasting, not just recipes.
- The emotional impact of dishes is considered alongside technical execution.
