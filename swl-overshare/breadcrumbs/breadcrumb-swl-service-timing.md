# Service Timing at Snow White Laundry

## Summary
Service timing at Snow White Laundry is the orchestration of pace and rhythm that creates a coherent dining experience. Timing is not just about speed, but about creating space for conversation, reflection, and appreciation. The goal is to move guests through a meal at a pace that feels natural, not rushed or stalled.

Timing considers multiple factors: the complexity of dishes, the size of the party, the energy of the room, the needs of individual guests. Service must be flexible enough to adapt to these factors while maintaining overall coherence. Some guests want a faster pace; others want to linger. The service adapts within reason.

The timing of service is documented and taught. Staff understand the intended pace and how to read signals that indicate when to speed up or slow down. This understanding enables autonomous decision-making that still aligns with the restaurant's philosophy.
