# Greeting Rituals at Snow White Laundry

## Summary
Greeting rituals at Snow White Laundry set the tone for the entire experience. The way guests are welcomed—at the door, at the table, throughout the meal—communicates care, attention, and intention. These rituals are not scripted performances, but intentional practices that create comfort and connection.

The greeting ritual recognizes that every guest arrives with different needs and expectations. Some want conversation; others want quiet. Some are celebrating; others are seeking comfort. The greeting adapts to meet guests where they are while maintaining consistency in care and attention.

Rituals are documented and taught, but they are not rigid. Staff understand the purpose behind the ritual—to make guests feel seen, welcomed, and cared for—and can adapt the execution to individual circumstances. The ritual serves the purpose, not the other way around.
