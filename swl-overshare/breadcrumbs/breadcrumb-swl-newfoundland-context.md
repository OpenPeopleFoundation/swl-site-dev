# Newfoundland Context at Snow White Laundry

## Summary
Snow White Laundry is explicitly a restaurant in St. John’s, Newfoundland, not a concept that could be dropped unchanged into any city. Weather, light, supply chains, and local habits all inform how the restaurant operates.

The aim is to be in conversation with the city: respectful of its rhythms while quietly introducing new patterns. Locals should feel that the restaurant belongs here, even as it pushes into new territory.

## Core Principles
- Local guests are treated as long‑term partners, not one‑time visitors.
- The calendar of the restaurant acknowledges local seasons and events.
- Design and menu choices avoid generic global style in favour of grounded specificity.

## Signals & Behaviours
- Language on the website and menu clearly references St. John’s and Newfoundland.
- Locals recognise details of their own lives in the stories and service.
- Visiting guests leave with a clearer sense of place, not just a generic fine‑dining memory.
