# Newfoundland Seasons at Snow White Laundry

## Summary
Newfoundland seasons at Snow White Laundry shape every aspect of the restaurant's relationship with ingredients and menu. The seasons are distinct and influential: late spring, brief summer, harvest fall, long winter. Each season brings different ingredients, different challenges, and different opportunities.

Spring arrives late, often not until May. It brings the first fresh greens, but in limited quantities. Summer is brief and intense, with long daylight hours that concentrate flavors in berries and vegetables. Fall brings harvest and preparation for winter. Winter is long, requiring reliance on preserved and stored ingredients.

The restaurant works with these seasons, not against them. The menu evolves to reflect what is available when. Techniques adapt to work with seasonal ingredients. The challenge is to create dishes that honor each season's character while maintaining consistency in quality and experience.
