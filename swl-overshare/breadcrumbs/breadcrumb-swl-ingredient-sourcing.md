# Ingredient Sourcing at Snow White Laundry

## Summary
Ingredient sourcing at Snow White Laundry is built on relationships, not transactions. The restaurant works directly with local producers, understanding their constraints, their seasons, and their stories. This relationship-based approach ensures quality, supports local agriculture, and creates a supply chain that reflects place.

Sourcing decisions are made with intention. Every ingredient must justify its place not just in terms of flavor, but in terms of sustainability, ethics, and alignment with the restaurant's values. The goal is not perfection, but progress toward more responsible sourcing.

The restaurant recognizes that local sourcing in Newfoundland comes with challenges. The growing season is short. Weather can disrupt supply chains. Producers operate on smaller scales. These constraints are not obstacles to overcome, but parameters to work within, shaping the menu and the restaurant's relationship with place.

## Core Principles
- Build relationships with producers, not just purchase orders.
- Understand the constraints and realities of local sourcing.
- Prioritize quality and ethics over convenience or cost.
- Document sourcing decisions and their reasoning.
- Adapt menus to what is available, not what is desired.
