# Emotion at Snow White Laundry

## Summary
Emotion at Snow White Laundry is treated as a design parameter, not an accident. The goal is not constant intensity, but a controlled emotional arc that moves from curiosity and comfort toward quiet satisfaction.

The restaurant recognises that every guest arrives with a different emotional baseline. Service is designed to be gentle enough to meet people where they are, while still leaving room for delight.

## Core Principles
- Hospitality is measured by how guests feel leaving, not only by what they consumed.
- Emotional load on staff must be managed with as much care as emotional impact on guests.
- Calm, unhurried interaction is preferable to performative enthusiasm.

## Signals & Behaviours
- Guests describe the night using emotional language: calm, seen, held, energized.
- Staff debriefs include emotional check‑ins, not just service notes.
- The room’s energy is intentionally modulated through pacing and sound.
