# Acoustics at Snow White Laundry

## Summary
Acoustics at Snow White Laundry are designed to support conversation and calm, not to eliminate sound entirely. The restaurant seeks a balance where guests can hear each other and the staff without straining, where the room has energy but not noise, where music enhances rather than dominates.

The acoustic design uses materials and layout to control reverberation and background noise. Surfaces are chosen to absorb rather than reflect sound. The layout prevents sound from bouncing between hard surfaces. The goal is a room that feels alive but not overwhelming.

Music is part of the acoustic environment, not separate from it. Volume and selection are calibrated to support the emotional arc of service without dominating conversation. The music should feel present but not noticed, contributing to atmosphere without demanding attention.
