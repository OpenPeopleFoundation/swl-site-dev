# Cuisine Philosophy at Snow White Laundry

## Summary
Snow White Laundry’s cuisine is rooted in Newfoundland ingredients and conditions, interpreted through a modern, chef‑driven lens. The goal is not strict regionalism, but honest use of place.

The menu is designed to feel precise but not rigid, allowing seasonal shifts and guest feedback to shape the evolution of dishes. Technique serves flavour and narrative, not ego.

## Core Principles
- Ingredients from Newfoundland are used whenever they can be sourced responsibly.
- Dishes should be conceptually clear: guests understand what is on the plate and why.
- Complexity in the kitchen should result in simplicity and clarity for the guest.

## Signals & Behaviours
- Menu descriptions are short but specific.
- Suppliers and producers are known by name and story.
- Menu changes track the seasons and the realities of the local supply chain.
