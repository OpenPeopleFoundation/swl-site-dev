# Lighting Design at Snow White Laundry

## Summary
Lighting design at Snow White Laundry is treated as a tool for shaping emotional experience, not just visibility. The restaurant uses lighting to create calm, intimate spaces that support reflection and connection. Light levels are calibrated to be flattering but not dim, clear but not harsh.

The lighting system is designed to be flexible, allowing adjustment throughout service to match the natural progression of evening into night. Early service might be brighter; later service might be softer. This flexibility supports the emotional arc of the guest experience.

Lighting also serves operational needs. Staff must be able to see clearly to execute their work. Food must be visible and appealing. But these functional requirements are met without sacrificing the emotional quality of the space. The goal is lighting that serves both purpose and atmosphere.
