# Craft at Snow White Laundry

## Summary
Craft at Snow White Laundry is the disciplined practice of translating intention and emotion into repeatable execution. It covers everything from knife work and station setup to tasting discipline and service choreography.

Craft is defined not just by technical skill, but by the willingness to refine, document, and teach that skill. The restaurant treats craft as a shared asset, not a private secret.

## Core Principles
- Techniques must be documented so they can be taught consistently.
- Craft is evaluated by both precision and the emotional effect on the guest.
- Local constraints (ingredient availability, weather, supply chains) are embraced as part of craft.

## Signals & Behaviours
- Prep lists, recipes, and plating diagrams are kept current and accessible.
- Training time is scheduled, not improvised.
- Dishes become more coherent over time without losing their character.
