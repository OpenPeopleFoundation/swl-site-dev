# Documentation Systems at Snow White Laundry

## Summary
Documentation systems at Snow White Laundry preserve institutional memory and enable consistent execution. The restaurant documents techniques, recipes, service protocols, and decisions so they can be taught, refined, and maintained over time. Documentation is treated as a craft, requiring clarity, organization, and regular maintenance.

The systems recognize that people leave, memories fade, and details are forgotten. Documentation ensures that knowledge persists beyond individual staff members, that techniques can be taught consistently, and that decisions can be understood and evaluated later.

Documentation serves multiple purposes: training new staff, maintaining consistency, enabling reflection, supporting iteration. It is not just about recording what is done, but about explaining why it is done, creating a foundation for understanding and improvement.

## Core Principles
- Documentation preserves institutional memory.
- Techniques and decisions must be documented to be teachable.
- Documentation should explain why, not just what.
- Systems must be organized and accessible.
- Documentation requires regular maintenance and updates.

## Signals & Behaviours
- New techniques are documented before they become standard.
- Staff can access documentation when needed.
- Documentation is updated when processes change.
- Training relies on documented systems, not just oral tradition.
- Documentation supports both consistency and evolution.
