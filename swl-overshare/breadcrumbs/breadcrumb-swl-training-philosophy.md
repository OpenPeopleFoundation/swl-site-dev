# Training Philosophy at Snow White Laundry

## Summary
Training at Snow White Laundry is treated as a continuous process, not a one‑time onboarding event. The restaurant assumes that people learn best through a mix of clear documentation, shadowing, and structured feedback.

Training is designed to protect both standards and individuality: people are given strong foundations without being forced into identical personalities.

## Core Principles
- Every role has written expectations and key skills.
- New hires are paired with mentors wherever possible.
- Feedback is bilateral: staff are encouraged to critique systems, not just receive critique.

## Signals & Behaviours
- Training materials are updated when processes change.
- Staff can describe what 'good' looks like in their role.
- Skill growth over months is visible and trackable.
