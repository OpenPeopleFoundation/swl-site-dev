# Music Curation at Snow White Laundry

## Summary
Music curation at Snow White Laundry treats music as part of the emotional design of the space, not just background noise. Playlists are designed to support the arc of service, moving from energy to calm, from conversation to reflection. The music should feel present but not noticed, contributing to atmosphere without demanding attention.

Selection is guided by the restaurant's aesthetic: calm, reflective, elegant, minimal. The music should align with the monochrome, poetic tone of the restaurant. It should support the emotional experience without competing with it. Volume is calibrated to enhance conversation, not replace it.

Playlists are documented with clear reasoning. Staff understand why certain music is chosen and when it should be played. The curation process is intentional, not arbitrary. Music becomes another tool for shaping the guest experience, another expression of the restaurant's philosophy.
