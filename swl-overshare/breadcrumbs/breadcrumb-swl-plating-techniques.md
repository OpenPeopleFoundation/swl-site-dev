# Plating Techniques at Snow White Laundry

## Summary
Plating techniques at Snow White Laundry serve the dish, not the ego. The goal is not to create art for its own sake, but to present food in a way that enhances flavor, communicates intention, and supports the emotional arc of the meal. Plating must be beautiful, but beauty serves purpose.

The techniques are documented so they can be taught consistently. Plating diagrams show composition, placement, and proportions. These diagrams are living documents, refined through practice and observation. They ensure consistency while allowing for the variations that come with working with natural ingredients.

Plating considers the entire experience: how the dish looks when it arrives, how it changes as it is eaten, how it relates to other courses. The visual design supports the flavor design, creating coherence across senses.

## Core Principles
- Plating serves flavor and intention, not decoration.
- Techniques must be teachable and repeatable.
