# Restraint at Snow White Laundry

## Summary
Restraint at Snow White Laundry is the discipline of knowing what to leave out. It recognizes that absence can be as powerful as presence, that silence can be as meaningful as sound, that simplicity can be more profound than complexity. Restraint is not about doing less for its own sake, but about doing exactly what is needed and nothing more.

Restraint applies to every aspect of the restaurant: menu design, service interactions, space design, communication. It asks: does this element serve a purpose? Does it enhance the experience? Or is it there because it is expected, because it is impressive, because it fills space?

The practice of restraint requires confidence. It is easier to add than to subtract, easier to fill than to leave empty. But restraint creates clarity, focus, and impact. It allows what remains to speak more clearly, to have more weight, to create more meaning.
