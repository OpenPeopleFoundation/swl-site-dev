# Emotional Arc at Snow White Laundry

## Summary
The emotional arc at Snow White Laundry is the intentional design of how guests feel throughout their experience. The arc moves from curiosity and comfort toward quiet satisfaction, creating a journey that feels natural and unforced. Each element—greeting, menu, pacing, food, service—contributes to this arc.

The arc is not linear or predictable. It has moments of surprise, recognition, comfort, challenge, and satisfaction. These moments are orchestrated to create depth and interest without overwhelming. The goal is not constant intensity, but a range that feels appropriate and meaningful.

Designing the emotional arc requires understanding how different elements affect emotion: lighting, sound, pacing, food, service, space. These elements work together to create a coherent experience. The arc is refined through observation, reflection, and iteration.
