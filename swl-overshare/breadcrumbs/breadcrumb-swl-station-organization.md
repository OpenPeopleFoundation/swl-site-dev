# Station Organization at Snow White Laundry

## Summary
Station organization at Snow White Laundry is the foundation of efficient, consistent execution. Each station is set up with intention, considering what needs to be accessible, what can be prepared ahead, and what must be done to order. Organization is not just about efficiency, but about creating conditions that support craft.

The organization of a station reflects the philosophy of intention, emotion, and craft. Tools are placed where they are needed. Ingredients are organized by use and timing. The station supports the cook's ability to execute at a high level while maintaining calm and focus.

Station organization is documented and taught. New staff learn not just where things go, but why they are organized that way. This understanding enables adaptation when circumstances change, while maintaining the principles that make organization effective.
