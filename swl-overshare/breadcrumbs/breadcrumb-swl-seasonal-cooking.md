# Seasonal Cooking at Snow White Laundry

## Summary
Seasonal cooking at Snow White Laundry is not a marketing concept, but a practical necessity. Newfoundland's distinct seasons—late spring, brief summer, harvest fall, long winter—shape what is available when, and the restaurant's menu must adapt to these rhythms rather than fight against them.

The restaurant treats seasonality as both constraint and opportunity. Winter requires reliance on preserved and stored ingredients, but these ingredients have their own character, their own stories. Spring brings the first fresh greens, but in limited quantities. Summer is intense but brief. Fall is harvest and preparation.

Seasonal cooking requires planning and flexibility. Dishes conceived in summer must work with winter ingredients. Techniques developed for fresh produce must adapt to stored roots. The menu evolves continuously, not in dramatic seasonal overhauls, but in gradual shifts that reflect what is available.

## Core Principles
- Work with seasonal availability, not against it.
- Preserve and store ingredients to extend their use.
- Develop dishes that can adapt to ingredient variations.
- Document seasonal patterns and plan accordingly.
- Honor the character of ingredients in each season.

## Signals & Behaviours
- Menu changes reflect seasonal shifts, not arbitrary dates.
- Staff understand seasonal patterns and can explain them to guests.
- Preservation techniques are practiced and refined.
- The restaurant maintains relationships with producers across seasons.
- Winter menus celebrate stored ingredients, not apologize for them.
