# Texture Design at Snow White Laundry

## Summary
Texture design at Snow White Laundry treats texture as an essential element of flavor, not a secondary consideration. The interplay of textures—crisp and soft, smooth and rough, firm and yielding—creates interest and complexity. Texture can surprise, comfort, challenge, or satisfy.

Texture design considers the entire dish and the progression of a meal. A course might begin with one texture and evolve to another as it is eaten. The meal as a whole should have variety in texture, creating rhythm and interest. Too much of one texture becomes monotonous; too much variety becomes chaotic.

The design of texture requires understanding how ingredients behave, how techniques affect texture, and how textures interact. It requires tasting with attention to mouthfeel, not just flavor. It requires considering how texture affects the emotional experience of eating.

## Core Principles
- Texture is an essential element of flavor, not decoration.
- Texture variety creates interest and rhythm.
- Texture design considers the entire dish and meal progression.
- Techniques that affect texture must be understood and controlled.
