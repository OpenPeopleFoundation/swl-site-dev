# Preservation Techniques at Snow White Laundry

## Summary
Preservation techniques at Snow White Laundry extend the use of seasonal ingredients and honor traditional methods adapted to modern practice. The restaurant practices pickling, fermenting, curing, and storing not as novelty techniques, but as essential skills for working with Newfoundland's seasonal constraints.

These techniques are treated as craft, requiring knowledge, practice, and refinement. They are documented so they can be taught consistently. They are evaluated not just by technical success, but by how well they preserve flavor, texture, and the character of ingredients.

Preservation is not just about extending ingredient life, but about creating new flavors and textures. Fermented vegetables develop complexity. Pickled ingredients add brightness and acidity. Cured items develop depth. These preserved ingredients become components of dishes, not just substitutes for fresh.

## Core Principles
- Preservation techniques must be documented and teachable.
- Preserved ingredients should enhance dishes, not just extend availability.
- Traditional methods are respected but adapted to modern practice.
- Safety and quality are non-negotiable.
- Preservation is planned, not improvised.

## Signals & Behaviours
- Preservation projects are scheduled and documented.
- Staff are trained in preservation techniques and safety.
- Preserved ingredients are labeled, dated, and tracked.
- The restaurant maintains a library of preservation recipes.
- Preserved ingredients are used creatively, not just stored.
